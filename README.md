# Adopt

**If you seek consistent typography across all screen sizes, Adopt.js is for you.** It's a simple jQuery plugin that removes
[orphans](http://www.fonts.com/content/learning/fontology/level-2/text-typography/rags-widows-orphans)
from your elements.

### Usage

Include the jQuery library (version 1.8 or newer) and the Adopt.js
plugin file, *preferably at the bottom of the page before closing the
<code>body</code> tag*.

    <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="jquery.adopt.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      // To remove orphans from all headings.
      $('h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6').adopt();

      // To remove orphans from all article paragraphs.
      $("article p").adopt();
    </script>

### How it works

Adopt.js keeps orphans from forming by placing a <code>\&nbsp;</code> HTML entity
between the last two characters. This keeps them together when the
window resizes, ensuring no word is ever alone.
